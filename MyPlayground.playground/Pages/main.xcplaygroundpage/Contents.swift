 In the following questions, where we use the term `variable`, we are not specifying whether or not it's a variable that is declared with `var` or a constant which is declared with `let`. We are using this general term, leaving it up to you to decipher whether or not you need to use `var` or `let` within the solution.
 */
/*: question1
 ### 1. Create a variable which represents your bank account balance. (For example: What is a good name for this variable that makes it easily readable for myself now and for the future me _or_ other developers I might be working with? Should I declare it using `let` or `var`? Should it be of type `Int` or `String`?)
 */
// write your code here

var balance: Int

balance = 1000


/*: question2
 ### 2. You went to your local pet store and purchased yourself a puppy. You decided to name the puppy Bella. Once you named her, that name will stick with her forever. Create a variable that stores the name of your new puppy.
 */
// write your code here

let puppyname: String
puppyname = "Bella"

/*: question3
 ### 3. Use the `print()` function to print the name of your new puppy to the console.
 */
// write your code here

print(puppyname)


/*: question4
 ### 4. Use the `print()` function to print the sentence "I just got a new puppy named <your puppy's name> and she is awesome!" to the console.
 */
// write your code here

print("I just got a puppy named \(puppyname) and shw is awesome!")



/*: question5

/*: question6
 ### 6. Congratulations! You just got $100 for your birthday, so now you have $100 more in your bank account. Update your bank account with the new balance and print "I now have $<balance>." to the console.
