## Learning Objectives

* Create variables and constants using `let` and `var`.
* Use the `print()` function to print their `String` types to the console.
* Create variables of type `String` and `Int`.
* Create variables using *type inference* and *type annotations*.
* Use *string interpolation* to print out `String` literals to the console.

## Instructions

* Open up the playground file included with this repo and answer the listed questions (which you will find in the playground file) in order. 
* There are no tests associated with this playground file.
* The following two screenshots are included to assist you in case the file doesn't open right to the main.swift file (which it should by default).
* Make sure you're working in the main.swift file (which you can view by pressing command + 0):
